/**
 * LMAXSetup is a simple mock implementation of the LMAX Order Processing Application
 *  described in their presentations and Martin Fowler's blog writeup.
 * There are two Disruptors (RingBuffers).
 * There is one Publisher, the "LMAXReceiver" into Disruptor #1.
 * There are three parallel processors that gate on the LMAXReceiver (the "trio"):
 *  1. LMAXUnmarshaller
 *  2. LMAXJournaler
 *  3. LMAXReplicator
 * There is one processor that gates on the above three processors: 
 *  the Business Logic Processor (BLP)
 * The LMAX_BLP hands it off to some POJOs to business processing and then is the
 *  publisher onto the second Disruptor.
 * The second Disruptor has two processors that have to operate serially: first the 
 *  LMAXMarshaller and then the LMAX Publisher.  This latter one has a terrible name
 *  for the Disruptor pattern, so to avoid confusion, I call it the LMAXFinalHandler
 *
 * To simulate all this and ensure that things are done in the right order, I have constructed
 * an LMAXEvent that has one field for each of the "actors" in this scenario:
 * 
 * LMAXReceiver sets the pushedOnto1Id, incrementing by one
 * LMAXJournaler sets a "journalMessage" field stating that it was journaled and whether it was
 *  the first, second or third of the trio to handle it
 * LMAXReplicator sets a "replicatorMessage" field stating that it was replicated and whether it
 *  was the first, second or third of the trio to handle it
 * LMAXUnmarshaller sets a "unmarshalledMessage" field stating that it was unmarshalled and 
 *  whether it was the first, second or third of the trio to handle it
 * LMAX_BLP sets a "pulledOff1Id", incrementing by one and pushedOnto2Id, matching the pullOff1Id
 * LMAXMarshaller sets a "marshalled" boolean field to true
 * LMAXFinalHandler then checks that all fields above were set from their defaults, keeps
 *  track of how many went first from each of the trio, reports that to STDOUT and then 
 *  logs the result to a file "LMAX.output.txt".
